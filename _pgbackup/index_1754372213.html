                        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #aa0000;">My Story</h2>
                        <p>I am a former student of Marsha Fuerst School of Nursing – Riverside, as well as a whistleblower and journalist. I was a dedicated and high-achieving student, earning excellent grades and thriving academically. I even took time out of my studies to tutor fellow students free of charge. I had a dream of becoming a nurse — a dream that, in my view, was derailed by retaliation and a false narrative.</p>
                        <p>On July 3, 2025, I submitted formal Title IX complaints regarding protected concerns I had witnessed. Just days later, I was summoned by the campus Dean to a sudden, high-pressure meeting — under threat of being removed from clinicals — despite having spent the prior 3–4 days attempting to contact both the Dean and Clinical Coordinator, with no response.</p>
                        <p>When I arrived on campus, I respectfully requested to sign the paperwork in the hallway. This request was based on a prior disclosure to the Chief Nursing Officer of Success Education Colleges that I felt unsafe in closed-door meetings with certain administrators due to past unethical behavior. My ADA rights and disability-related concerns were dismissed. I was forced into a private office, where I experienced coercion, harassment, and targeted intimidation — all of which I believe constituted unlawful retaliation.</p>
                        <p>During the meeting, I was presented with a vague clinical document that included unclear expectations such as “ambulate the patient twice daily.” When I asked, “What if the patient is bedbound?” the clinical coordinator admitted she could not provide proper clarification and said I could speak with my professor the next day.</p>
                        <p>I then asked why I wasn’t reviewing and signing the document with my professor instead — a reasonable and logical question — but this was brushed aside with, “I’m not doing this with you.” I asked if I could take a photo of the document so I could review it later. That request was denied, and she again repeated, “I’m not doing this with you,” simply because I was standing up for my federally protected rights.</p>
                        <p>Moments later, the campus director — whom I had previously submitted a complaint against — backtracked and said I could have a copy. She then escalated pressure, stating that if I didn’t sign immediately, I might not be allowed to attend clinicals.</p>
                        <p>I reminded them that students have the legal right to review documents before signing and to receive proper education about expectations — which they clearly failed to provide. Instead of honoring that, they began portraying me as uncooperative for asserting my rights.</p>
                        <p>Disturbed by the interaction, I left the office visibly shaken. A concerned professor witnessed this and looked concerned for me. I told her, “They are so unethical,” twice. She entered the office, appearing ready to advocate on my behalf.</p>
                        <p>Shortly afterward, Gia — the Nursing Specialist who had witnessed the meeting — came out to check on me, which directly contradicts any later claim that they felt “threatened” by me. She attempted to de-escalate the situation in the hallway by encouraging me to sign — although her approach was more subtle than her colleagues’, it was still part of the ongoing pressure.</p>
                        <p>I believe this entire interaction was designed to rattle me and frame me as emotionally unstable. They knew there wouldn’t be witnesses in that office.</p>
                        <p>Before I left, I called for the resignation of those involved — a moment of emotional expression I now recognize may not have been ideal. But in my defense, no student with a formally recognized ADA diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder should ever be subjected to a coercive, high pressure meeting designed to intimidate, bully, and silence them.</p>
                        <p>I also calmly spoke to my friends from Cohort #3 for several minutes in front of the building. There was no sign of concern from staff, security, or faculty — no one asked me to leave or treated me as a threat, which directly contradicts the later claim that I was “threatening.”</p>
                        <p>Later that night, around 11:00 PM, I received an email stating I was banned from campus — many hours after the 2:30 PM meeting. I did not see the email until I was already on campus the next morning, where I was met with visible hostility from security. I believe this was preplanned to enhance the narrative that I was coming to school to cause disruption — which was absolutely not the case.</p>
                        <p>Upon reading the message, I left immediately and parked in a nearby public area. From my vehicle, I briefly recorded the security guard and the nursing specialist appearing to discuss me with someone over the phone. I suspected they might call police painting a false narrative of me, so I promptly left campus.</p>
                        <p>I was formally notified of my dismissal shortly afterward. I submitted an appeal, which was acknowledged — then ignored for 14 days. Two weeks later, I received my official expulsion notice.</p>
                        <p>I was falsely labeled as “threatening” — a characterization I adamantly reject and consider defamatory.</p>
                        <p>Now, before litigation proceeds, I am telling my story — not just for myself, but for every student who has been silenced, coerced, or discarded by systems that claim to serve education and justice, yet operate through intimidation and fear.</p>
                        <p>This archive was not created by choice, but by necessity — a direct response to systemic silencing, institutional evasion, and the attempted erasure of lived truth. What you find here may disturb, but it is not fiction. It is evidence. It is testimony. It is the record they tried to bury.</p>
                        <p>I will never back down until my record is cleared and the terms of my current good faith settlement proposal are fully met. My goal is to secure justice not only for myself but also for others through ethical means, including regulatory enforcement, public accountability, and legal remedy.</p>
                        <p>I have endured serious harm and psychological distress as a result of this institution’s actions. Throughout this process, I have acted ethically and in good faith, and I remain committed to holding all responsible parties accountable — through lawful and ethical means — whether their role involved direct misconduct, administrative negligence, or silent complicity. I believe these actions constitute unlawful retaliation against a federally protected student with a documented disability.</p>
                        <p>California’s nursing students deserve better, and I am committed to helping make that happen.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your support, your attention, and your belief in accountability.</p>
                        <p>The fight for truth is not easy — but it is necessary. And I will continue forward, not in anger, but in conviction.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Bobby Carter</strong> – Faculty witness to post-meeting distress. Appeared genuinely concerned. One of the few educators who treated students with dignity and respect.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bola Gyras</strong> – Biochemistry professor. When I raised curriculum concerns earlier in the program, he replied, “Maybe you don’t belong here.” A moment that revealed the gatekeeping mindset beneath the surface.
                    </li>
                    <br> 
                    <li>
                        <strong>Johnny Brown</strong> – Admissions Specialist. Involved in recruiting students at SEC. Based on my experience, some admissions decisions may have prioritized enrollment numbers over true readiness. Allegedly connected to internal practices where transcript or recommendation requirements are possibly delayed during enrollment—then giving the appearance of clearance, only for those same requirements to later be used to undermine student progress or justify dismissal. People should be either cleared before they start the program or they are not, how does this happen?
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sylvia Villegas</strong> – Informed me, a year and a half into the program, that two years of my transcripts were missing. How does that happen if I had supposedly already been cleared for enrollment? I had previously heard from other students that letters of recommendation were sometimes delayed until after acceptance — a practice that seems highly irregular. In my view, applicants should either be cleared up front or not at all — anything else risks administrative manipulation. I was told the missing transcript was now a graduation requirement — but this came only after I had filed formal complaints with the school and regulators. To me, it felt like a form of retroactive weaponization, designed to justify removing me. The timing and pattern suggest possible retaliation. I remain curious: who directed Ms. Villegas to revisit my admissions file during such a turbulent period?
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lilliana Bovaird</strong> – In my view, participated in passive retaliation, including the strategic use of clinical “sign-offs” — where certain students appeared to be prioritized or deprioritized for skill check-offs. When you don’t get signed off, it snowballs — and in my case, it did. I endured nearly three weeks of delayed skills assessments, despite raising concerns that my section had only one professor while others had two. I also believe I should have passed Pharmacology the first time, but was required to retake it — a decision I view as punitive, handed down by SEC corporate and MFSON administrators after I raised formal complaints. My concerns about outdated Pharmacology materials and the professor’s struggle with basic technology were never meaningfully addressed. To me, the entire situation felt orchestrated — a setup meant to delay or derail my progress.

Many alleged instances of retaliation over my time at MFSON Riverside. Known for closed doors and unanswered emails. Allegedly disrupted students both emotionally and logistically before major exams — now named in formal complaints. Appears increasingly out of her depth.

                <li>
                    <strong>Tammy Latu</strong> – At the center of ADA retaliation and coerive pre-planned event on July 7th, 2025. She has acted as though institutional rules don’t apply to her — a recurring theme among administrators at SEC. On earlier ocassions during my time in the ADN program she stalled my original ADA request despite my diagnosis being somewhat recent and having been cleared by the records department of my hospital with clearance from my psychiatrist at the time. Forced undue effort to go get a note written in the way she wanted it. Also during a closed door meeting earlier in the program she allegedly said, “You don’t have a leg to stand on. If we wanted you gone, you’d be gone.” This was reactionary to me bringing up Title IX Concerns, something that wasn't acknowledged by their multi-state Title IX COordinator until many months later. On another occassion closer to the time of the coercive event of July 7th, 2025, she Later deleted a message she had sent me denying me a neutral witness during a meeting with corporate. When records vanish, what’s being hidden? Investigators should check the meta data.

The patterns I’ve uncovered raise red flags of enterprise-level misconduct that may warrant scrutiny under the False Claims Act, civil RICO, or both — particularly where federal student aid, regulatory deception, and self-enrichment via real estate manipulation are involved.</p>

                        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Disclosures Silenced and Rerouted</h2>
                        <p>Success Education Colleges (SEC) has outsourced its whistleblower and compliance infrastructure through a rotating sequence of third-party vendors — including Lighthouse Services, Syntrio, and now Mitratech. What should function as an ethical reporting channel instead resembles a shell game, where serious concerns disappear into a closed loop of corporate containment.</p>
                        <p>These systems appear engineered not to protect whistleblowers, but to protect the institution from them — rerouting complaints away from regulators and into legal silos controlled by internal actors.</p>
                        <p><em>In other words: SEC didn’t build a whistleblower system. It built a firewall.</em></p>

                        <p>Two individuals — Cole Schlabach and Andrew Nydegger — appear to have acted in legal capacities during my expulsion, Title IX concerns, and record requests. Yet neither is licensed to practice law in California, nor do they appear as Registered In-House Counsel.</p>
                        <p>If true, this may constitute unauthorized practice of law (UPL).</p>

                        <h2 style="text-align: center;">No Malpractice Insurance — And No Explanation</h2>
                        <p>As of today, no public record exists showing that SEC or MFSON carry institutional malpractice insurance. The BPPE and BVNPT have both acknowledged in writing that they hold no records of such insurance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Students were placed in live clinical environments with no publicly verifiable institutional coverage.</strong></p>

                        <p>To this day, SEC refuses to release my full, unaltered transcript, trapping me in academic limbo — unable to transfer, recover, or rebuild the career I was promised.</p>

                        <h2 style="text-align: center;">I Was Not Just a Student</h2>
                        <p>This institution wasted over 18 months of my life. They now think offering a quiet refund will erase that harm. It won’t.</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 0.85rem; padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; text-align: left;">
                            <li>A refund does not undo retaliation.</li>

                            <li>A refund does not restore a future built in good faith.</li>

                        <p>In light of the documented retaliation, regulatory violations, and institutional misconduct, I now call for the following actions:</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 0.85rem; padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; text-align: left;">
                            <li>A multi-agency investigation into SEC and its affiliates — including Title IV disbursement and real estate-linked approvals</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>A legal guarantee that my academic records will not be altered or obstructed</li>
                            <li>A review of public agency accountability and failure to act</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 style="text-align: center;">If Agencies Remain Silent — the Public Will Speak</h2>
                        <p>Let this message serve as public notice:</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 0.85rem; padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; text-align: left;">

                        </ul>
                        <p>And, if necessary, the names of responsible officials will be published in the public interest.</p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: center;">California Nursing Students Deserve Better</h2>
                        <p>We don’t need another slogan.<br>
    We need protection.<br>
    We need justice.<br>
    We need truth in regulation — or we will go find it ourselves.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>These individuals currently oversee the BRN’s licensing, education oversight, and public protection operations. Despite documented Title IX retaliation, ADA interference, and reports of misconduct at a BRN-approved institution, no corrective action has yet been publicly acknowledged. Multiple outreach attempts — including whistleblower disclosures on June 19 and 20, 2025 — went unanswered, even after repeated requests for confirmation. The silence speaks volumes.</p>
                    <p>More troublingly, an SEC administrator once remarked: “We have a good relationship with the BRN.” This may be benign — or it may suggest a concerning level of familiarity. Even the appearance of undue influence can erode public trust.</p>
                    <h4>California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) – Leadership (As of August 2025):</h4>
                    <div class="regulator-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Deborah Cochrane – Bureau Chief<br>

                    </div>
                    <p>Despite multiple whistleblower disclosures submitted in June 2025, the BPPE has not publicly indicated any enforcement steps. Of further concern, both the BPPE and BVNPT confirmed in writing that they hold <strong>no records of malpractice or institutional liability insurance</strong> for Marsha Fuerst School of Nursing – Riverside or any SEC-operated campuses. Given that students were placed in clinical settings under state-approved programs, this absence may represent a serious oversight — and potentially a public risk.</p>
                    <h4>California Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians (BVNPT) – Key Members:</h4>
                    <div class="regulator-list">

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Like the BPPE, the BVNPT has confirmed it holds no malpractice or liability insurance records for SEC campuses. If these programs operated without such safeguards in place, it raises critical questions about patient safety and regulatory responsibility.</p>
                    <h4>ABHES – Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools:</h4>
                    <div class="regulator-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Timothy Lee – Chair, Board of Commissioners</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>ABHES has received reports of systemic misconduct and accreditation-related concerns at an institution under its purview. To date, no formal response has been made public. For accrediting bodies to retain trust, both transparency and timely response are essential.</p>
                    <h4>California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA):</h4>
                    <div class="regulator-list">

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>The DCA oversees both the BRN and BPPE. Despite documented harm, Title IX and ADA concerns, and a consistent lack of agency response, DCA has taken no visible action. This raises concerns about systemic inertia at the very top of California’s regulatory apparatus.</p>
                    <h4>Wider Oversight and Federal Awareness:</h4>
                    <p>Outreach has also begun to federal and state-level watchdogs — including the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the California Attorney General’s Office. These agencies are not listed to suggest fault, but to reflect the growing scope of concern and the hope that intervention may still come.</p>
                    <p><em>Reasonable observers may begin to ask:</em></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do regulatory agencies maintain true independence from those they oversee?</li>
                        <li>Could institutional lobbying or financial ties discourage enforcement?</li>
                        <li>Have the lines between oversight and complicity been blurred?</li>

At 11:01 AM, Dean Juana Ferrerosa sent this final warning demanding the student sign clinical paperwork by 2:00 PM “or risk clinical standing.” Despite the student reaching out for days prior to plan a time with adminstration which was completely ignored until the day of the short notice threat from Dr. Ferrerosa. The student's 1:29 PM reply shows compliance and intent to report retaliation. This message thread captures the pressure leading into the ambush meeting later that day.</strong></p>

This communication is central to allegations of retaliation, ADA violations, and administrative coercion following a disputed in-person meeting earlier that day. <br> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybLmz9aQ_FN1j1SW0rFPa-NnEih-vjBM/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">View Screenshot</a> <div id="trumpGenOutput" class="fuerst-section" style="display: none; margin-top: 16px;">

                        <br>
                        Screenshot of internal Microsoft Teams group titled <em>“MFSON Deans”</em> reveals unrestricted access to a full list of nursing leadership—including multiple Deans of Nursing, the Executive Dean, and Regional Director of Operations. This group was viewable by ordinary users, including students. Despite my reports to BRN, BPPE, and the Department of Education, no regulator acknowledged the exposure of internal structure or responded to my documented concerns.<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_TW2If2mmuUO4d2iROv1vkw_6JNuZJn/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">View Screenshot</a>

                        Internal email from Clinical Coordinator Jasmin Salazar urging students to “work together” on a required Prime Healthcare clinical exam to “get cleared.” I reported this multiple times to Success Education Colleges (SEC) leadership and to Prime Healthcare, yet no one has acknowledged it — not even once.<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kKUl_BtTcDc9SPToZsj-iVqvKbq2-d4D/view?usp=drive_link">View Document</a>

                <p>
    This page references Marsha Fuerst not to cast blame, but to honor the impact her name once carried. </p>
                <p>
    Marsha helped countless students begin careers in healthcare—many of whom went on to care for their families, support their communities, and uplift others. Her efforts changed lives, and for that, she deserves recognition. </p>
                <p>
    But when a name becomes a legacy, it also becomes a responsibility. </p>
                <p>
    I raised serious concerns about a clinical coordinator allegedly encouraging group cheating—an email sent to all of Cohort #4 that appeared designed to rush students through. These concerns were shared directly with SEC leadership, Prime Healthcare, and various regulatory agencies. Despite multiple follow-ups, no formal response was ever received. </p>
                <p>
  The image shown here is not intended as mockery or disrespect. It is used symbolically—to reflect the generational continuity of power and to question how that power is now being exercised. Under Mitchell Fuerst’s leadership, an empire continues to operate under Marsha’s name. And yet... troubling silence. </p>
                <p>
    Would Marsha have ignored these kinds of allegations? Would she have allowed them to go unacknowledged? </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
    A legacy is not only remembered.<br>
    It is upheld—or it is betrayed. </p>
